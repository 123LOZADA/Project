            <h2> MY PERSONAL CONNECTION</h2>
            <p>I first discovered BLACKPINK when I heard one of their songs online, and from that moment, I was hooked. 
                Their music wasn't just catchy  it was powerful and full of confidence. Watching them perform made me feel inspired, 
                like I could be strong and fearless too. Each member has her own charm: Jisoo's calm beauty, Jennie's stage presence, Rose's emotional voice, 
                and Lisa's incredible dancing.

                As I learned more about them, I realized how much hard work and dedication they put into everything they do. 
                They're not just idols; they're role models who remind me to chase my dreams and never give up. 
                Following BLACKPINK has given me amazing experiences from watching their concerts online to meeting other BLINKs who share the same passion.

                What I hope others will learn from BLACKPINK is that success doesn't come easily, but with effort, teamwork, and self-belief, anything is possible. 
                They've taught me that being "BLACK" and "PINK" means embracing both strength and softness and that's something I'll always carry with me.</p>
