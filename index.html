            <h2> WHY I CHOOSE THIS TOPIC
            </h2>
            <p>I love BLACKPINK because they inspire me in so many ways. 
                Each member shows a unique personality and talent like Jisoo's confidence, Jennie's charisma, Rose's passion, and Lisa's energy remind us that we can shine in our own ways too. 
                Their music is powerful and empowering, mixing strength and beauty, just like their name. BLACKPINK's songs motivate us when we're feeling down and bring us together as fans, no matter where we come from. 
                They've taught us to be confident, to chase our dreams, and to never give up. To us, BLACKPINK isn't just a K-pop group they represent hard work, friendship, and the belief that anything is possible when you love what you do.
